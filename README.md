# Bioinformatics reports covered in Northwestern Quantitative and Systems Biology(QSB) master program

The repository contains three folders including two course reports: ./STAT_465-0 and ./RNA-seq analysis with a focus on DESeq2 R package taught by Kath.
./nuseq core folder covers the custom scripts written during the internship at Northwestern Sequencing Core. The overarching goal is to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data assigned by multiple laboratories.
./systems biology contains one report that summarizes one publication with the Nature News and Views format.
One manuscript of the thesis presentation can be found [here](http://simp.ly/publish/9T1hXb)
