# Bioinformatics reports covered in Northwestern Quantitative and Systems Biology(QSB) master program

The repository contains three folders including two course reports: [STAT_465-0](./STAT_465-0) and [RNA-seq analysis](./RNA-seq_analysis) with a focus on DESeq2 R package taught by Kath.
[nuseq core](./nuseq_core) folder covers the custom scripts written during the internship at Northwestern Sequencing Core. The overarching goal is to analyze single-cell RNA sequencing data assigned by multiple laboratories.
[systems biology](./systems_biology) contains one report that summarizes one publication with the Nature News and Views format. [qsb thesis](./qsb_thesis) contains the final thesis submitted as a bonus.
